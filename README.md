This Repository contains all information related to the ISBOS JavaScript Club which meets Fridays at 3:30pm


The club's main goal is to look at programming in the real world (games, software...etc) and to do so, we examine basic programming concepts which are listed below:

# Variables


#### Code Examples

```javascript
var x; //This creates a variable called x
x = 5; //This sets the value of variable x to 5
var t = "hi"; //This creates a variable called t and sets its value to "hi"
r = "sam"; //This is invalid because a variable named r hasn't been created yet
```
